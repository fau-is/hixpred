## Data Set Characteristics

To conduct our experiments, we used a publicly available dataset: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Sepsis_Cases_-_Event_Log/12707639
As a predition target, we considered the Admission to IC which constitutes a possible outcome of a patientâ€™s pathway, indicating whether a patient is required to transfer to the IC unit. Overall the dataset contains 995 instances with 98 positive labels.
