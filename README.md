## Data Set Characteristics

To conduct our experiments, we used a publicly available dataset: https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/Sepsis_Cases_-_Event_Log/12707639.
As a predition target, we considered the Admission to IC which constitutes a possible outcome of a patientâ€™s pathway, indicating whether a patient is required to transfer to the IC unit. Overall the dataset contains 995 instances with 98 positive labels. 

The data set contains static and sequential features. The static features are all categorical, e.g., the activity.
Characteristics of the four sequential features can be found in the table below.
